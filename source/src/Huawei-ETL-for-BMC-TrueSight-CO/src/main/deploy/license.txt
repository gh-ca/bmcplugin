CONTACT BMC OR YOUR BMC RESELLER FOR A REFUND OF LICENSE FEES PAID. IF YOU REJECT THIS AGREEMENT, YOU 
WILL NOT ACQUIRE ANY LICENSE TO USE THE PRODUCT. 

This Agreement ("Agreement") is between the entity or individual entering into this Agreement ("Customer") and the BMC Entity for

usage restrictions contained in the Product installation instructions or release notes shall apply to your use of the Product. 

Territory: The country where Customer acquired the license. 

1. 
GENERAL DEFINITIONS. 
"Affiliate" is an entity that controls, is controlled by or shares common control with BMC or Customer, where such control arises 
from either (a) a direct or indirect ownership interest of more than 50% or (b) the power to direct or cause the direction of the 
management and policies, whether through the ownership of voting stock by contract, or otherwise, equal to that provided by a 
direct or indirect ownership of more than 50%. 
"Documentation" means the technical publications relating to the software, such as release notes, reference, user, installation, 
systems administrator and technical guidelines, included with the Product. 
"Licensed Capacity" is the amount of each Product licensed as established in the Order. 
"Order" is an agreed written or electronic document, subject to the terms of this Agreement that identifies the Products to be 
licensed and their Licensed Capacity and/or the Support to be purchased and the fees to be paid. 
"Product" is the object code of the software and all accompanying Documentation delivered to Customer, including all items 
delivered by BMC to Customer under Support. 
"Support" is the support services program as further specified in this Agreement. 
2. SCOPE. Licenses are granted, and Support is obtained, solely by execution of Orders. Each Order is deemed to be a discrete 
contract, separate from each other Order, unless expressly stated otherwise therein, and in the event of a direct conflict between any 
Order and the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Order will control only if the Order is executed by an authorized representative 
of each party. Orders may be entered under this Agreement by and between (a) BMC or an Affiliate of BMC; and (b) the Customer or 
an Affiliate of Customer. With respect to an Order, the terms "BMC" and "Customer" as used in this Agreement will be deemed to refer 
to the entities that execute that Order, the Order will be considered a two party agreement between such entities, and BMC will 
separately invoice the Customer named in the Order for the associated License fees and Support fees. Neither execution of this 
Agreement, nor anything contained herein, shall obligate either party to enter into any Orders. In the event an Order is proposed by 
BMC and is deemed to constitute an offer, then acceptance of such offer is limited to its terms. In the event Customer proposes an 
Order by submitting a purchase order, then regardless of whether BMC acknowledges, accepts or fully or partially performs under such 
purchase order, BMC OBJECTS to any additional or different terms in the purchase order, other than those that establish Product, 
price and Licensed Capacity in accordance with this Agreement. 
3. LICENSE. Subject to the terms, conditions, payment requirements and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, BMC grants 
Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable perpetual (unless a non-perpetual license is provided on an Order) 
license, as specified in the relevant Order, to exercise the following rights to the Product up to the Licensed Capacity: (a) copy the 
Product for the purpose of installing it on Customer's owned or leased hardware at a facility owned or controlled by Customer in the 
Territory; (b) operate solely for Customer's and its Affiliates own internal Customer's business operations; and (c) make one copy of 
the Product for archival purposes only (collectively a "License"). Affiliates may use and access the Products and Support under the 
terms of this Agreement, and Customer is responsible for its Affiliates compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 
4. RESTRICTIONS. Customer will not: (a) copy, operate or use any Product in excess of the applicable Licensed Capacity; (b) 
modify, delete or remove any ownership, title, trademark, patent or copyright notices ("Identification") from any Product; (c) copy any 
Product or any portion of any Product without reproducing all Identification on each copy or partial copy; (d) disassemble, reverse 
engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to derive any Product source code from object code, except to the extent expressly permitted 
by applicable law despite this limitation without possibility of contractual waiver; (e) distribute, rent, lease, sublicense or provide the 
Product to any third party or use it in a service bureau, outsourcing environment, or for the processing of third party data; (f) provide a 
third party with the results of any functional evaluation, or performance tests, without BMC's prior written approval; (g) attempt to disable 
or circumvent any of the licensing mechanisms within the Product; or (h) violate any other usage restrictions contained in the 
Documentation. 
5. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE WARRANTY. BMC warrants that (a) the Product will perform in substantial accordance with its 
Documentation for a period of one year from the date of the first Order, (b) BMC has used commercially reasonable efforts consistent 
with industry standards to scan for and remove software viruses, and (c) other than passwords that may be required for the operation of 
the Product, BMC has not inserted any code that is not addressed in the Documentation and that is designed to delete, interfere with or 
disable the normal operation the Products in accordance with the License. This warranty will not apply to any problems caused by 
hardware, Computers, or software other than the Product, or misuse of the Product use of the Product other than as provided by the 
applicable License, modification of the Product, or claims made either outside the warranty period or not in compliance with the notice 
and access requirements set forth below. No warranty is provided for additional Licensed Capacity, Product provided pursuant to 
Support or Product provided pursuant to Section 11.

6. LIMITED REMEDIES. BMC's entire liability, and Customer's exclusive remedy, for breach of the above warranty is limited to: 
BMC's use of commercially reasonable efforts to have the Product perform in substantial accordance with its Documentation, or 
replacement of the non-conforming Product within a reasonable period of time, or if BMC cannot have the Product perform in 
substantial accordance with its Documentation replace the Product within such time period, then BMC will refund the amount paid by 
Customer for the License for that Product. Customer's rights and BMC's obligations in this section are conditioned upon Customer's 
providing BMC during the warranty period (a) full cooperation and access to the Product in resolving any claim; and (b) written notice 
addressed to the BMC Legal Department that includes notice of the claim, a complete description of the alleged defects sufficient to 
permit their reproduction in BMC's development or support environment, and a specific reference to the Documentation to which such 
alleged defects are contrary. 
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRODUCT IS 
PROVIDED WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, AND BMC, ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL 
OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR 
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. BMC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT 
WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ALL DEFECTS CAN BE CORRECTED. 
8. PAYMENTS AND DELIVERY. Customer will pay each License fee and/or Support fee upon receipt of invoice. Customer will pay, 
or reimburse, BMC or when required by law the appropriate governmental agency for taxes of any kind, including sales, use, VAT, 
excise, customs duties, withholding, property, and other similar taxes (other than taxes based on BMC's net income) imposed in 
connection with the License and/or the Support fees which are exclusive of these taxes. For Products that are delivered electronically, 
upon request from BMC, Customer agrees to provide BMC with Documentation supporting that the designated Product was received 
electronically. If Customer accepts any Product in a non-electronic format, there may be an additional charge and it is the sole 
responsibility of Customer to bear any sales/use tax obligation, penalties, and interest. The unpaid balance of each late payment bears 
interest at a rate equal to the lesser of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law. All Products are licensed FCA ("Free 
Carrier" as per Incoterms 2000) shipping point. The Products are accepted on the date BMC delivers the Product to the Customer 
either physically or by providing access codes for electronic download, whichever occurs first, however, such acceptance will not affect 
the Product Performance Warranty provided in this Agreement. 
9. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) BMC, its Affiliates or licensors retain all right, title and interest to the 
Product, Support and all related intellectual property and proprietary rights. The Product and all third party software provided with the 
Product are protected by applicable copyright, trade secret, industrial and other intellectual property laws. Customer may not remove 
any product identification, copyright, trademark or other notice from the Product. BMC reserves any rights not expressly granted to 
Customer in this Agreement. (b) "Confidential Information" means all proprietary or confidential information that is disclosed to the 
recipient ("Recipient") by the discloser ("Discloser"), and includes, among other things (i) any and all information relating Discloser 
financial information, customers, employees, products or services, including, without limitation, software code, flow charts, techniques, 
specifications, development and marketing plans, strategies, forecasts, and proposal related documents and responses; (ii) as to BMC, 
and its licensors, the Product and any third party software provided with the Product; and (iii) the terms of this Agreement, including 
without limitation, Product pricing information. Confidential Information does not include information that Recipient can show: (a) was 
rightfully in Recipient's possession without any obligation of confidentiality before receipt from the Discloser; (b) is or becomes a matter 
of public knowledge through no fault of Recipient; (c) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without violation of a duty of 
confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by or for Recipient. Recipient may not disclose Confidential Information of Discloser to 
any third party or use the Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement. The Recipient (i) will exercise the same degree of care 
and protection with respect to the Confidential Information of the Discloser that it exercises with respect to its own Confidential 
Information and (ii) will not, either directly or indirectly, disclose, copy, distribute, republish, or allow any third party to have access to 
any Confidential Information of the Discloser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Discloser's Confidential 
Information to Recipient's employees and agents who have the need to know provided that such employees and agents have legal 
obligations of confidentiality substantially the same (and in no case less protective) as the provisions of this Agreement. (c) 
Notification Obligation. If the Recipient becomes aware of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser's Confidential Information, 
then Recipient will promptly and fully notify the Discloser of all facts known to it concerning such unauthorized use or disclosure. In 
addition, if the Recipient or any of its employees or agents are required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, or 
documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or other similar process) to disclose any of Discloser's 
Confidential Information, the Recipient will not disclose the Discloser's Confidential Information without providing the Discloser with 
commercially reasonable advance prior written notice to allow Discloser to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or to 
waive compliance with this provision. In any event, the Recipient will exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the 
confidentiality of the Discloser's Confidential Information, including, without limitation, cooperating with Discloser to obtain an 
appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information. 
10. DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES; LIMITS ON LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR VIOLATIONS OF LICENSE (SECTION 3), LICENSE 
RESTRICTIONS (SECTION 4), PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY (SECTION 9) AND FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS 
(SECTION 12), NEITHER PARTY, ITS AFFILIATES OR BMC'S LICENSORS ARE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, SUPPORT, 
THE PRODUCT OR ANY THIRD PARTY CODE OR SOFTWARE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST COMPUTER USAGE TIME, AND DAMAGE TO, OR LOSS OF USE OF DATA), EVEN IF 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF NEGLIGENCE OF A PARTY OR WHETHER 
SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM A CLAIM ARISING UNDER TORT OR CONTRACT LAW OR (B) DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN AN 
AMOUNT GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL, DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT PAID AND 
PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER FOR THE LICENSE TO THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT GIVING RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES. 
EULA (07.07.2013) Page 2 of 12 BMC Confidential 


11. TRIAL LICENSE. BMC may determine, in its sole discretion, to make products available to Customer without an Order and without 
charge Such products are deemed to be "Products" pursuant to this Agreement except that (a) they are provided to Customer solely so 
that Customer may evaluate internally whether to acquire a license to the products for a fee, (b) the license term for such products is 
thirty (30) days; (c) the Products are provided "AS IS" and without any warranty or support, and (d) the products cannot be put into 
productive use or included as part of Customer's business processes in any manner, unless or until they are expressly licensed and 
paid for under an Order. BMC may terminate all of Customer's rights and licenses to these products for BMC's convenience upon 
notice to Customer. 
12. INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. If a third party asserts a claim against Customer asserting that Customer's use of a Product in 
accordance with this Agreement violates that third-party's patent, trade secret or copyright rights ("Infringement Claim"), then BMC 
will, at its own expense: (a) defend or settle the Infringement Claim; and (b) indemnify Customer for any damages finally awarded 
against Customer based on infringement by the Product. BMC's obligations under this Section will not apply if: (a) BMC's legal 
department does not receive prompt, detailed written notice of the Infringement Claim from Customer, (b) BMC is not able to retain sole 
control of the defense of the Infringement Claim and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise, (c) BMC does not receive all 
reasonable assistance, or (d) the Infringement Claim is based on (i) the use of Product in combination with products not approved by 
BMC in the Product's Documentation, (ii) the failure of Customer to use any updates to such Product within a reasonable time after 
such updates are made available to Customer, or (iii) the failure of Customer to use the Product as permitted by the Order and in 
accordance with the Documentation. BMC will not bind Customer to a monetary obligation in a settlement or compromise, or make an 
admission on behalf of Customer, without obtaining Customer's prior consent. If BMC determines in BMC's reasonable discretion that 
use of the Product should be stopped because of an Infringement Claim or potential Infringement Claim, if a court of competent 
jurisdiction enjoins Customer from using a Product as a result of an Infringement Claim and BMC is unable to have such injunction 
stayed or overturned, or if BMC settles an Infringement Claim on terms that would require Customer to stop using the Product, then 
BMC will, at its expense and election: (a) modify or replace the Product, (b) procure the right to continue using the Product, or (c) if in 
BMC's reasonable judgment, neither (a) or (b) is commercially reasonable, terminate Customer's License to the Product and (i) for any 
perpetual licenses, issue a refund based upon the applicable license fees paid, prorated over 48 months from the date of the Order 
under which the Products were initially licensed; and (ii) for any non-perpetual licenses, release Customer from its obligation to make 
future payments for the Product or issue a pro rata refund for any fees paid in advance. This Section contains Customer's exclusive 
remedies and BMC's sole liability for Infringement Claims. 
13. TERMINATION. Upon thirty days advance written notice, either party may terminate this Agreement for its convenience on a 
prospective basis; however, such termination will have no effect on Orders executed by the parties prior to its effective date and such 
Orders will remain in full force and effect under the terms of this Agreement. BMC may: (i) terminate an Order and the Licenses to the 
Products on that Order if Customer fails to pay any applicable fees due under that Order within 30 days after receipt of written notice 
from BMC of non-payment; (ii) terminate any or all Orders, Licenses to the Products and/or this Agreement, without notice or cure 
period, if Customer violates the intellectual property rights of BMC, its Affiliates or licensors, or uses the Products outside of the scope 
of the applicable Licenses; or (iii) terminate all Licenses and this Agreement in whole or in part if Customer commits any other material 
breach of this Agreement and fails to correct the breach within 30 days after BMC notifies Customer in writing of the breach. Upon any 
termination of a License, Customer will immediately uninstall and stop using the relevant Product, and upon BMC's request, Customer 
will immediately return such Product to BMC, together with all related Documentation and copies, or certify its destruction in writing. 
Neither party is liable for its failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement, other than a payment obligation, during any period 
in which performance is delayed by circumstances beyond that party's reasonable control. 
14. AUDIT. If requested by BMC not more than once a year, Customer agrees to deliver to BMC periodic product usage reports 
generated from specific products (when available) or written reports, whether generated manually or electronically, specifying 
Customer's use of the Product. Additionally, if requested by BMC not more than once a year, Customer agrees to allow BMC to 
perform an audit at Customer's facilities during normal business hours to ensure compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 
Customer agrees to cooperate during any such audit and to provide reasonable access to its information and systems. If an audit 
reveals that Customer has exceeded the Licensed Capacity for a Product, Customer agrees to pay the applicable fees for additional 
capacity. If the understated capacity exceeds 5% of the Licensed Capacity of the applicable Product, then Customer agrees to also pay 
BMC's reasonable costs of conducting the audit. 
15. EXPORT CONTROLS. By using the Technology (as this term is defined below), Customer acknowledges that it is responsible 
for complying with the applicable laws and regulations of the United States and all other relevant countries relating to exports and reexports. 
Customer agrees that it will not download, access, license or otherwise export or re-export, directly or indirectly, any software 
code (delivered as a BMC Product, through support/maintenance, or through other services), any technical publications relating to the 
software code, such as release notes, reference, user, installation, systems administrator and technical guidelines, or 
services (collectively, "Technology") in violation of any such laws and regulations, including regulations prohibiting export to certain 
restricted countries ("Restricted Countries"), or without any written governmental authorization required by such applicable laws. The 
list of Restricted Countries can and does change from time to time. It currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. In 
particular, but without limitation, the Technology may not be downloaded, licensed, transferred or otherwise exported or re-exported, 
directly or indirectly, including via remote access (a) into a Restricted Country or to a national or resident of a Restricted Country; (b) to 
anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or Other Blocked Persons, the U.S. Commerce 
Department's Denied Parties List, Entity List, or Unverified List; or (c) to or for any proliferation-related (nuclear weapons, missile 
technology, or chemical/biological weapons) end use. By downloading, licensing and/or using the Technology, Customer represents 
and warrants that (w) it is not located in, under the control of, acting on behalf of, or a national or resident of any Restricted Country; (x) 
Customer is not on any list in (b) above; (y) Customer is not involved in any end use listed in (c) above; and (z) no U.S. federal agency 
has suspended, revoked, or denied its export privileges. Customer agrees that all rights to use the Technology are granted on the 
condition that such rights are forfeited if it fails to comply with these terms. 
EULA (07.07.2013) Page 3 of 12 BMC Confidential 


EC No. 428/2009 sets up a Community regime for control of exports of dual-use items and technology, and it is declared that this 
Technology is intended for civil purposes only. Therefore, Customer agrees not to license, download or transfer, directly or indirectly 
any Technology controlled by it to any military entity or to any other entity for military purposes, including any State Security Forces 
pursuant to this Agreement, nor to knowingly transfer any Technology to end-users for use in connection with chemical, biological or 
nuclear weapons or missiles capable of delivering such weapons. Customer also agrees, (a) not to export or re-export any Technology 
to an entity that is based in China and describe themselves as "Institute(s)" or "Academy(ies)"; or (b) not to knowingly export or reexport 
any Technology to any country that is subject to European Union, United Nations or Organizations for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe sanctions without first obtaining a validated license. 

16. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is governed by the substantive laws in force, without regard to conflict of laws principles: (a) 
in the State of Texas, if you acquired the License in the United States, Puerto Rico, or any country in Central or South America; (b) in 
the Province of Ontario, if you acquired the License in Canada (subsections (a) and (b) collectively referred to as the "Americas 
Region"); (c) in Singapore, if you acquired the License in Japan, South Korea, Peoples Republic of China, Special Administrative 
Regions of Hong Kong or Macau, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, 
Thailand, India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea or any of the pacific island states (collectively, "Asia Pacific 
Region"); or (d) in the Netherlands, if you acquired the License in any other country not described above. The United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed in its entirety. 
17. ARBITRATION. ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND BMC ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH 
OR ALLEGED BREACH, SHALL BE DETERMINED BY BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH. IF THE DISPUTE IS 
INITIATED IN THE AMERICAS REGION, THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE HELD IN NEW YORK, U.S.A., UNDER THE CURRENT 
COMMERCIAL OR INTERNATIONAL, AS APPLICABLE, RULES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. IF THE 
DISPUTE IS INITIATED IN A COUNTRY IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE HELD IN SINGAPORE, 
SINGAPORE UNDER THE CURRENT UNCITRAL ARBITRATION RULES. IF THE DISPUTE IS INITIATED IN A COUNTRY OUTSIDE 
OF THE AMERICAS REGION OR ASIA PACIFIC REGION, THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE HELD IN AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS 
UNDER THE CURRENT UNCITRAL ARBITRATION RULES. THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE BORNE EQUALLY 
PENDING THE ARBITRATOR'S AWARD. THE AWARD RENDERED SHALL BE FINAL AND BINDING UPON THE PARTIES AND 
SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO APPEAL TO ANY COURT, AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT 
JURISDICTION. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED AS PREVENTING EITHER PARTY FROM SEEKING 
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FROM ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTIES AND THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE 
DISPUTE AS NECESSARY TO PROTECT EITHER PARTY'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OWNERSHIP, OR ANY OTHER 
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. ALL ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN CONFIDENCE, AND THE PARTY 
PREVAILING IN ARBITRATION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ITS REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND NECESSARY 
COSTS INCURRED RELATED THERETO FROM THE OTHER PARTY. 
18. U.S. FEDERAL ACQUISITIONS. This Article applies to all acquisitions of the commercial Product subject to this Agreement by or 
on behalf of the federal government, or by any prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) under any contract, grant, cooperative 
agreement or other activity with the federal government. By accepting delivery of the Product, the government hereby agrees that the 
Product qualifies as "commercial" within the meaning of the acquisition regulation(s) applicable to this procurement. The terms and 
conditions of this Agreement shall pertain to the government's use and disclosure of the Product, and shall supersede any conflicting 
contractual terms and conditions. If the license granted by this Agreement fails to meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in any 
respect with Federal law, the government agrees to return the Product, unused, to BMC. The following additional statement applies only 
to acquisitions governed by DFARS Subpart 227.4 (October 1988): "Restricted Rights – Use, duplication and disclosure by the 
Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software 
clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 (Oct. 1988)."

20. ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFERS. Customer may not assign or transfer a Product separate from the applicable Agreement and 
License, and may not assign or transfer an Agreement or a License, except in the event of a merger with or into, or a transfer of all or 
substantially all of Customer's assets to, a third party who assumes all of Customer's liabilities and obligations under the Agreement 
and License, and expressly agrees in writing to be bound by and comply with all of the terms of the Agreement and License. Except as 
specifically authorized by applicable law, any attempt to assign or transfer an Agreement or License in violation of this provision will be 
null and void and be treated as a violation of BMC's intellectual property rights or use outside the scope of the License. 
21. FORCE MAJEURE. Any delay or failure of any party to perform any obligation under this Agreement caused by governmental 
restrictions, labor disputes, storms or natural disasters, emergency, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of the party, will not 
be deemed a breach of this Agreement. This provision does not apply to the payment of monies or any breach of Section 9. 
22. DATA PROTECTION. (a) Customer acknowledges that BMC neither requires nor needs Customer to (i) send BMC any personal 
data collected by Customer ("Customer Collected Data") or (ii) give BMC access to any Customer Collected Data. Consequently, 
Customer remains responsible for either filtering, making anonymous, encrypting such Customer Collected Data or for having proper 
procedures in place to prevent Customer Collected Data from being sent to or accessed by BMC. (b) In the course of normal business, 
BMC may collect and process personal information related to the Customer (mainly contact and related information) in order to perform 
its obligations under this Agreement and/or under an Order, such information being referred to hereinafter as "Customer Contact 
Information". BMC undertakes to comply with all the relevant data protection legislation and/or regulations where the Customer 
Contact Information is to be processed. BMC shall in particular : (i) allow Customer to access, modify, correct or erase Customer 
Contact Information when necessary; (ii) take reasonable technical and organizational security measures to maintain the confidentiality 
and integrity of Customer Contact Information and to prevent its unauthorized access, use, or disclosure; (iii) refrain from transferring 
any Customer Contact Information to any third party without obtaining the express consent of the person to whom Customer Contact 
Information relates to, and (iv) refrain from using Customer Contact Information for any other purpose than performing its obligations 
under this Agreement and/or any Order. 
23. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS. A waiver by a party of any breach of any term of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of 
any continuing or succeeding breach. Should any term of this Agreement be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain in 
effect. The parties acknowledge they have read this Agreement and agree that it is the complete and exclusive statement of the 
agreement and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous negotiations or agreements, between the parties relating to the subject 
matter of this Agreement. There are no representations, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings between the parties other 
than those expressly set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified or rescinded except in writing signed by both 
parties. The prevailing party in any litigation is entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs from the other party. Customer agrees 
that BMC and its affiliates may refer to Customer as a customer of BMC, both internally and in externally published media. The BMC 
Products may contain both open source code ("Open Source") and proprietary third party code (together "TPS") which is delivered to 
Customer as part of the Product and may not be taken out of the Product or used separately from the Product ("Embedded TPS"). 
Embedded TPS is included in the defined term "Product" and is covered by all of the terms of the Agreement, including but not limited 
to, the warranty and indemnification responsibilities of BMC. Some terms related to Embedded TPS may be included in the 
Documentation due to requirements of the TPS licensor, however these terms will not (1) impose any additional restrictions on 
Customer's use of the Product, or (2) negate or amend the BMC responsibilities with respect to the Embedded TPS in the Product (or 
the Product itself). If the Open Source is also distributed separately by BMC pursuant to requirements by the owner of the Open 
Source, then Customer may separately use the Open Source and such use will be subject to the separate license agreement that 
accompanies the Open Source and not the BMC Agreement. 
24. SUPPORT. Customer may acquire BMC support services ("Support") on an Order. Once Support is acquired for a Product, 
Customer is automatically enrolled in Support on an annual basis for all Licensed Capacity of that Product, unless either party 
terminates Support on all Licensed Capacity of a Product upon at least 30 days written notice prior to the next Support anniversary 
date. The annual fee for Support will be agreed upon at the time of each Order. For a description of Support go to 
www.bmc.com/support/review-policies. BMC may change its Support terms, to be effective upon Customer's support anniversary 
date. BMC reserves the right to discontinue Support for a Product where BMC generally discontinues such services to all licensees of 
that Product. If Customer terminates Support and then re-enrolls in Support, BMC may charge Customer a reinstatement fee. 
25. 
ADDITIONAL TERMS. The following additional terms are incorporated into this Agreement. 
a. 
DEFINITIONS. Terms set forth below have the indicated meaning regardless of whether they are capitalized. 
"Client" means a third party whose data is processed by Customer and is only permitted if Customer is an authorized BMC service 
provider.

of a Computer's programs and refers to the "socket" which can contain one or more processor cores. 
per database: A license is required for the total allocated database space per host ID or physical Computer which the Product is 
managing. The total allocated database capacity cannot be segregated or aggregated into lower or higher ranges. 
per deployed robot: A license is required for all PATROL End-to-End Response Timer robots deployed. 
per Device Endpoint: A license is required for each Device Endpoint. "Device Endpoint" means a personal digital assistant or similar 
computing device. 
per engine: A license is required for each mainframe general purpose engine on the server upon which the Product is installed and/or 
manages regardless of whether the Product or one of its components is installed on that Server. 
per enterprise: A license is required per Customer and per Client each, regardless of the number of times Customer installs the 
Product in its Enterprise or its Client's Enterprise. 
per gigabyte: A license is required for the total allocated database space of all Computers on which the Product has been installed or 
operated. 
per gigabyte range: A license is required for the total allocated database space per host ID or physical Computer which the Product is 
managing. The Product may not be moved to another Computer unless the current Computer is taken out of service. The total allocated 
database capacity cannot be segregated or aggregated into lower or higher ranges among different Computers. For example: if 
Customer licenses 26-50 gigabytes, the Customer is only licensed for a maximum of 50 gigabytes in total across all the databases of 
the licensed Product on one particular Computer. 
per installed server: A license is required for each Server (with a Classification at the appropriate Tier level, if applicable) upon which 
the Product or any of its components is installed. 
per instance: A license is required for all named occurrences of the Product created or installed in the Enterprise. 
per Linux engine: A license is required for all engines of a mainframe Computer on which Customer is running Linux, when applicable 
classified by Linux Group using BMC's standard Computer classification. 
per managed asset – Device Endpoint: A license is required for every Device Endpoint that is monitored, managed, or discovered by 
the Product(s). A "Device Endpoint" can be any virtual or physical Non-Server Client Computer (e.g. laptop, desktop computer, PDA, 
smart phone); any network device (e.g. router, switch, hub) standalone or chassis-based device/card/processor using a unique-IP 
address (also includes virtual network devices managed through the IP address of its physical host); and independent storage (e.g. a 
disk array, a fiber switch, a tape library, a switch director). When applicable, the license must be computed at the appropriate tier level. 
per managed asset – server endpoint: A license is required for every Server Endpoint monitored, managed (directly or indirectly), or 
discovered by the Product(s). "Server Endpoint" is any virtual or physical Computer that provides a service for other Computers or 
users connected to it via the Internet, extranet, intranet, or other networked technologies. 
per managed component: A license is required for all objects that represent a physical or logical part of the service model managed by 
the Product. 
per managed network device: A license is required for each Network Device managed using a unique IP-address. "Network 
Device" means a standalone or chassis-based network device/card/processor. 
per managed server: A license is required for each Server managed by the Product or one of its components whether locally or 
remotely. When applicable, this license must be computed at the appropriate tier level based on the cumulative count of managed 
servers. Network Devices are not counted as Servers. This license does not include the Product's installation on or management of 
Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) engines. "Network Device" means a standalone or chassis-based network device/card/processor. 
per MIPS: A license is required for the total aggregate number of MIPS for each Computer, including all Computers coupled in a parallel 
Sysplex environment, upon which the Product is installed, managed or monitored. MIPS Rating is the aggregate computing power 
(expressed in millions of instructions per second) of a Computer, using the MIPS rating set forth in the then current Gartner Group 
Rating Guide. Computer-specific passwords will be issued for the Product. 
per monitored element: A license is required for all remotely monitored elements, such as a Server, database, operating system, URL, 
firewall, storage, or network device. 
per monitored server: A license is required for each Server (with a Classification at the appropriate Tier level, if applicable) which the 
Product or one of its components is monitoring regardless of whether the Product is monitoring it locally or remotely. 
per named user: A license (with a Classification at the appropriate Level, if applicable) is required for all individual employees or 
contractors or clients of Customer to whom access has been granted to the Product on a computer or multiple computers typically via 
the issuance of a unique ID regardless of whether the individual is actively using the Product at any given time. 
per node: A license is required for the maximum number of Nodes which the Product manages and/or monitors. "Node" means a 
network device (IP or non-IP) such as a router, switch or Computer. 

per port: A license is required for each port. A port is defined as a physical connection point used by a storage device to connect 
other devices or systems. For the purpose of BMC licensing, all active ports (Fibre Channel, iSCSI, etc.) for all managed devices 
(storage arrays, filers, tape libraries, etc.) are counted. Ports on hosts, gateways and switches are not to be counted. 
per project: A license is required for each specific project, facility or business unit, as the case may be specified at the time of order.

per Server Endpoint: A license is required for each Server Endpoint. A "Server Endpoint" is any virtual or physical Computer that 
provides a service for other Computers or users connected to it via the Internet, extranet, intranet, or other networked technologies. 
per Service Management MIPS: A license is required for the total aggregate number of MIPS for each Computer, including all 
Computers coupled in a parallel Sysplex environment, upon which the Product is installed, managed or monitored. MIPS Rating is the 
aggregate computing power (expressed in millions of instructions per second) of a Computer, using the MIPS rating set forth in the then 
current Gartner Group Rating Guide. 
per site: A license is required for the physical site at which the Product is installed regardless of the number of times the Product is 
installed. 
per task: For all Control-M Products, except those that are restricted to the Mainframe environment, a license is required for the 
maximum number of Tasks (as defined below) present in the Control-M "Active Jobs" databases in any 24-hour period, regardless of 
whether the Tasks execute or not. For the Control- M Mainframe add-on products, a license is required for the maximum number of 
Tasks (as defined below) present in solely the Mainframe environment's Control-M "Active Jobs" database. Tasks in the Control-M 
"Active Jobs" databases include all Tasks that are monitored by Control-M in all Distributed Systems and/or Mainframe environments 
(including but not limited to development, staging, QA, pre-production, production, and test environments), except that, (i) SMART 
folders/table and sub-folders/tables which contain scheduling definitions and are listed as tasks in the "Active Jobs" databases are not 
counted as Tasks, (ii) Tasks that have time zone settings may remain in the "Active Jobs" databases for up to three consecutive days, 
but are only counted as one Task, (iii) a Task that runs more than once during the day (with the same Order ID) is counted as one Task 

– this includes Tasks that are rerun and cyclic Tasks, and (iv) Tasks that are provided for by licenses under alternative Units of 
Measurement (i.e. tier or MIPS) are not considered Tasks under this "per task" unit of measurement. The number of steps or scripts 
executed within the named Task shall have no bearing upon the number of Tasks licensed. "Task" is interchangeable with "job" and 
means an executable command containing the name of the JCL, CL, DCL, ECL, script or dummy processes that is scheduled to 
execute, as well as the scheduling criteria, flow control, and resource usage. 
per terabyte: A license is required for the total aggregate storage capacity in the Enterprise. 
per third-party software: A license is required for each installation of the third-party software product that interfaces with the Product.
